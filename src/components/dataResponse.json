      "\tThe Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) started as the Manila Business School (MBS) on October 1, 1904. It was founded in response to the demand to train individuals for government and private service employment. The MBS operated as part of the City School System under the superintendence of G.A. O'Reilly.",
      
      "\tThe school's first offerings included vocational-technical courses mostly for working students from the provinces. Four years later, the school became a national school and was renamed the Philippine School of Commerce (PSC). PSC offered four-year secondary courses in Commerce in addition to vocational-technical courses like bookkeeping, stenography, typewriting and telegraphy. In 1917, PSC under the leadership of its Acting Principal Luis F. Reyes, started to offer night classes to enable the young people with daytime employment acquire further training. However, due to the retrenchment policy of the government in 1932, the night school had to be discontinued, and the PSC operations had to be merged with that of the Philippine Normal School and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades in 1933.",
      
      "\tIn 1940, President Manuel L. Quezon, in his graduation address, vowed to seek appropriations from the National Assembly to build a separate School of Commerce while Congressman Manuel A. Alazarte and PSC Superintendent Luis F. Reyes presented a bill to Congress for the said purpose. These efforts though, were thwarted when World War II broke out. After the war, PSC continued to offer one- and two-year courses in retailing, merchandising, and four-year course in distributive arts education while still merged with PNS, until PSC Superintendent Luis Reyes applied for the acquisition of its own place to the Philippine Alien Property Administrator through AMalaca√±ang and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Two old government buildings at Lepanto and S.H. Loyola Streets in Sampaloc District of Manila were turned over for the exclusive use of the PSC."
